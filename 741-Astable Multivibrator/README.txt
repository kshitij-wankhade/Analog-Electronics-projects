741 Op-Amp Astable Multivibrator


This is a Astable Multibrator made using 741 Op-Amp,designed to generate continuous square wave without any external input or trigger. I build this project during my 1st year of Electronics Engineering to understand wave generation and to get hand on experience with components.

-----

Working Principle-
The Op-Amp is configured as a comparator with positive feedback, causing it to switch output between +Vsat to -Vsat continuously.
The capacitor charges and discharges repeatedly, causing oscillation and blinking of two leds at two different outputs voltage.

Components Used-
1. Op-Amp ic 741
2. R1,R2 of 1k
3. Feedback Resistor of 10K
4. Capacitor of 47uf
5. LEDs
6. Power supply
7. Breadboard and jumper cables

-----

Applications-
1. Square Wave generator
2. LED flasher indicator
3. Clock pulses for digital circuits
